I was connecting my HTC phone to another computer and I realized I didn't have
appropriate permissions to the device. After I plugged in the device adb gave
me the following error:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>/usr/local/android/platform-tools/adb devices -l
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
????????????           no permissions usb:1-2
---

Googling around I found this post on how to fix it:

The are similar instructions on the adroid page here:

the post was for ubuntu and it included a lot of covered a lot of phones,
which I didn't really need. So I decided to create my own udev rules for
my fedora 17 install. The first thing that we need to is figure out the
device path of our usb phone. After plugging the phone into the usb slot,
we will see the following in dmesg:

---
[1004050.455351] usb 1-2: USB disconnect, device number 18

---

We can see that our device is sdb, now using udev we can query the device for
more information like so:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>udevadm info -q all -n /dev/sdb
P:
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.2/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.0/host18/target18:0:0/18:0:0:0/block/sdb

The most important information is the following:

---
DEVPATH=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.2/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.0/host18/target18:0:0/18:0:0:0/block/sdb

E: ID_VENDOR=HTC
E: ID_VENDOR_ENC=HTC\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0bb4
---

Now based on that information we need to create a udev rule to allow others to
write to the device. Actually using udev again, we can print a more 'udev'
friendly output, like so:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>udevadm info -a -p /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.2/usb1/1-2

Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

  looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.2/usb1/1-2':
    KERNEL=="1-2"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb"
    DRIVER=="usb"
    ATTR{configuration}==""
    ATTR{bNumInterfaces}==" 2"
    ATTR{bConfigurationValue}=="1"
    ATTR{bmAttributes}=="80"
    ATTR{bMaxPower}=="  2mA"
    ATTR{urbnum}=="2662"
    ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4"
    ATTR{idProduct}=="0c86"
    ATTR{bcdDevice}=="0228"
    ATTR{bDeviceClass}=="00"
    ATTR{bDeviceSubClass}=="00"
    ATTR{bDeviceProtocol}=="00"
    ATTR{bNumConfigurations}=="1"
    ATTR{bMaxPacketSize0}=="64"
    ATTR{speed}=="12"
    ATTR{busnum}=="1"
    ATTR{devnum}=="19"
    ATTR{devpath}=="2"
    ATTR{version}==" 2.00"
    ATTR{maxchild}=="0"
    ATTR{quirks}=="0x0"
    ATTR{avoid_reset_quirk}=="0"
    ATTR{authorized}=="1"
    ATTR{manufacturer}=="HTC"
    ATTR{product}=="HTC"
    ATTR{serial}=="HT164T500742"
--- 

Now copying the above ouput let's create a new rules file under
/etc/udev/rules.d/51-phone.rules and put the following into the file:

---
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4",GROUP="elatov",MODE="0666"
---

The reason why the file is order number 51 is because by default the OS
changes the permission of all USB devices to 664 in order number 50. Here
is the file and line that does that:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>grep usb /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules | grep MODE
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", MODE="0664"
---

Anyways, now let's reload the rules and restart the udev daemon:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
moxz.dnsd.me:~>sudo systemctl restart udev
moxz.dnsd.me:~>sudo systemctl status udev
udev.service - udev Kernel Device Manager
          Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/udev.service; static)
          Active: active (running) since Tue, 05 Feb 2013 13:28:13 -0800; 5s
ago
        Main PID: 28367 (udevd)
          CGroup: name=systemd:/system/udev.service
                  â”” 28367 /usr/lib/udev/udevd
---

That looks good. Now we have to uplug the device and plug it back it. First
let's check out the current permissions on the device. Here is a list of the
usb devices:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 413c:3200 Dell Computer Corp. Mouse
Bus 001 Device 019: ID 0bb4:0c86 High Tech Computer Corp.
---

The last one is the phone (bus 001, Device 019), now checking out the
persmissions of the file corresponding to that device, we see this:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/019 
crw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 18 Feb  5 13:06 /dev/bus/usb/001/019
---

Now uplugging the phone and plugging it in we see the following:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 413c:3200 Dell Computer Corp. Mouse
Bus 001 Device 020: ID 0bb4:0c86 High Tech Computer Corp.
---

We can see that the device id has changed. Now checking out the permissions of
the file now:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/020 
crw-rw-rw- 1 root elatov 189, 19 Feb  5 13:31 /dev/bus/usb/001/020
---

That all looks good. Now listing the available devices with adb we see
the following:

---
moxz.dnsd.me:~>adb devices
List of devices attached 
HT164T500742    device
---
