Found some instructions here:

# proceeding to the next step, ran into this
elatov@fed:~$wget -q -O - http://linux.dell.com/repo/firmware/bootstrap.cgi | sudo bash
the firmware respository is obsolete and unmaintained. Please use the OMSA repository instead for official updates.

# so then ran into this page:
http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Tech/libsmbios_dellBiosUpdate
# decided to give it a try, first install the binary:
elatov@fed:~$sudo yum install smbios-utils-python
# then getting the system information
elatov@fed:~$sudo getSystemId

# looking over this page

# it didn't have the latest version. It only had up to A25, then latest version was A29

elatov@fed:~/downloads$sudo inventory_firmware
Wait while we inventory system:
System inventory:
	System BIOS for Latitude E6500 = A18

# I then decided to see if that dell package is available:

elatov@fed:~$yum search firmware-addon-dell
Loaded plugins: langpacks, refresh-packagekit, remove-with-leaves
======================= N/S matched: firmware-addon-dell =======================
firmware-addon-dell.x86_64 : A firmware-tools plugin to handle BIOS/Firmware for
                           : Dell systems

  Name and summary matches only, use "search all" for everything.

# so then I installed the package
elatov@fed:~$sudo yum install firmware-addon-dell
# then I extracted the hdr file from the exe
$wine E6500A29.exe -writehdrfile -nopause
# lastly to install the bios run the following
sudo dellBiosUpdate -u -f 1525_A17.hdr

Initially I just wanted to extract the bios file with extract-hdr, but that seems to be missing now:
