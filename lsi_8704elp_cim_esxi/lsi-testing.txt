So one of the VirtualDisks was setup as a RAID-1:

# ./MegaCli -LDInfo -L0 -a0

So I decided to offline the second drive in the Raid:

# ./MegaCli -PDOffline -PhysDrv [6:1] -a0
                                     
Adapter: 0: EnclId-6 SlotId-1 state changed to OffLine.

Of course as soon as I did that the Alarm went off :) So let's go ahead and silence that:

# ./MegaCli -AdpSetProp AlarmSilence -a0
                                     
Adapter 0: Set alarm to Silenced success.


Now of course the status of the raid is degraded:

./MegaCli -LDInfo -L0 -a0
                                     

Adapter 0 -- Virtual Drive Information:

checking out vsphere client I now saw warnings and checking out Veeam One Monitor an alarm was fired for that
and if an SMTP server was configure then email was sent.

Then I went ahead and brought the drive back:

./MegaCli -PDOnline -PhysDrv [6:1] -a0
                                     
EnclId-6 SlotId-1 state changed to OnLine.

Then checking the VirtualDrive information, I was back to optimal:

./MegaCli -LDInfo -L0 -a0
                                     

Adapter 0 -- Virtual Drive Information:

Also checking out the logs, I saw the following:

./MegaCli -AdpEventLog -GetEvents -f /tmp/events.log -aALL && tail -40 /tmp/events.log

and the alarm went okay on the Veeam side:

and of course on the vSphere Client side as well.
