After installation, you need to edit the ossec.conf file to reflect
the correct settings for your environment.  All the files related
to ossec-hids have been installed in /usr/local/ossec-hids and
its subdirectories.

For information on proper configuration, see http://www.ossec.net/.

To enable the startup script, add ossechids_enable="YES" to
/etc/rc.conf.  To enable database output, execute:

/usr/local/ossec-hids/bin/ossec-control enable database

Then check this documentation:

http://www.ossec.net/doc/manual/output/database-output.html

When you deinstall this port after starting the daemons once, many
directories that are created by the daemons will remain.  To fully
remove the port you need to delete those directories manually.  To
further enhance the security on your system, you may also enable
some checks in PAM for a fast reaction against intrusions.

      block in quick from <ossec_fwtable> to any
      block out quick from any to <ossec_fwtable>



 - You first need to add this agent to the server so they 
   can communicate with each other. When you have done so,
   you can run the 'manage_agents' tool to import the 
   authentication key from the server.
