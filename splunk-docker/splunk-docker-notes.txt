### Install docker-compose on coreos
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /opt/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /opt/bin/docker-compose
###

### get the splunk docker image
docker pull splunk/splunk:latest
###

### Then copy over the etc and var directories to the cores machine
# for persistent storage
sudo mv splunk-etc.tar.bz2 /root/splunk/.
sudo mv splunk-var.tar.bz2 /root/splunk/.
# extract it
cd /root/splunk
tar xjf splunk-var.tar.bz2
tar xjf splunk-etc.tar.bz2
###

### Create a docker compose file to start the image and mount volumes
# cat docker-compose.yml 
version: '2'
services:
    splunk:
       image: splunk/splunk:latest
       hostname: splunk
       environment:
        SPLUNK_START_ARGS: --accept-license --answer-yes
        SPLUNK_ENABLE_LISTEN: 9997
        SPLUNK_ADD: udp 514
        SPLUNK_USER: root
       volumes:
        - /root/splunk/etc:/opt/splunk/etc
        - /root/splunk/var:/opt/splunk/var
       ports:
        - "8000:8000"
        - "9997:9997"
        - "8088:8088"
        - "514:514/udp"
       restart: always

## To confirm the configuration is okay, we can run the following:

# docker-compose config
networks: {}
services:
  splunk:
    environment:
      SPLUNK_ADD: udp 514
      SPLUNK_ENABLE_LISTEN: 9997
      SPLUNK_START_ARGS: --accept-license --answer-yes
      SPLUNK_USER: root
    hostname: splunk
    image: splunk/splunk:latest
    ports:
    - 8000:8000
    - 9997:9997
    - 8088:8088
    - 514:514/udp
    restart: always
    volumes:
    - /root/splunk/etc:/opt/splunk/etc:rw
    - /root/splunk/var:/opt/splunk/var:rw
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}

# to update you can stop the service
docker-compose stop
docker pull splunk/splunk:latest
docker-compose up -d

### Although I beleive each time you do a docker-compose up, it checks to make sure you have the latest image :)
