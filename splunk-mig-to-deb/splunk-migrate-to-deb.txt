--------------------------------------------------------------------------------)

Splunk has detected an older version of Splunk installed on this machine. To
finish upgrading to the new version, Splunk's installer will automatically
update and alter your current configuration files. Deprecated configuration
files will be renamed with a .deprecated extension.

You can choose to preview the changes that will be made to your configuration
files before proceeding with the migration and upgrade:

If you want to migrate and upgrade without previewing the changes that will be
made to your existing configuration files, choose 'y'.
If you want to see what changes will be made before you proceed with the
upgrade, choose 'n'.

It started up fine but it was complaining about the libpcre.so file, I checked
it out and the file was pointing to the correct location it just had a left
over file:

┌─[elatov@kerch] - [/opt/splunk/lib] - [2016-04-23 10:04:47]
└─[0] <> ls -l | grep pcre
lrwxrwxrwx  1 splunk splunk      16 Mar 25 21:40 libpcre.so -> libpcre.so.1.2.6
lrwxrwxrwx  1 splunk splunk      16 Mar 25 21:40 libpcre.so.1 -> libpcre.so.1.2.6
-r-xr-xr-x  1 splunk splunk  280640 Mar 25 21:45 libpcre.so.1.2.6
-r-xr-xr-x  1 splunk splunk  264272 Nov 17 18:29 libpcre.so.3

checking over the file it was the old Freebsd file:

┌─[elatov@kerch] - [/opt/splunk/lib] - [2016-04-23 10:04:47]
└─[0] <> ls -l | grep pcre
lrwxrwxrwx  1 splunk splunk      16 Mar 25 21:40 libpcre.so -> libpcre.so.1.2.6
lrwxrwxrwx  1 splunk splunk      16 Mar 25 21:40 libpcre.so.1 -> libpcre.so.1.2.6
-r-xr-xr-x  1 splunk splunk  280640 Mar 25 21:45 libpcre.so.1.2.6
-r-xr-xr-x  1 splunk splunk  264272 Nov 17 18:29 libpcre.so.3

So I just moved the file out of the way:

And restarted for good measure and it looked good:

┌─[elatov@kerch] - [/home/elatov] - [2016-04-23 10:07:55]

Done.
